Start by assuming the largest number is very small
    largestNumber ← 0
Keep asking the user for numbers until they enter 0
   
        PRINT "Please enter a positive number (enter 0 to finish):"
        READ userNumber

        IF userNumber > largestNumber THEN
            largestNumber ← userNumber
        END IF

    UNTIL userNumber = 0

    PRINT "The biggest number you entered is: ", largestNumber
